## Data Story: How much money do you need to live in different European countries?

This project is a part of coursework of Data Visualisation from University of Southampton.

A project consist of narrative, interactive data story with related charts and data (Eurostat) to provide information in visual way.

Used **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** to build an interactive data story. Utilized Javascript (Google Charts JS) and Tableau to create graphs. Added interactivity, tooltips, toolbars to all the graphs.

The idea to have an outcome 3 files (html, css and js), so the data is automatically included in JS file (which can be done by having separate JSON file or CSV files). Tableau graphs and data is included from my personal Tableau account.

Manipulated raw data from Eurostat about living prices with python to have two outcomes:
- CSV data for Tableau
- JSON for JS Google Chart (Dictionaries)

- **Tableau** graphs: 
1. European map
2. European map with pie charts

- **JS** graphs: 
- Line graphs by separate European region
- Vertical Stacked Bars
- Horizontal Stacked Bars
